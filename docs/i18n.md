# Internationalization (i18n)

The application supports Vietnamese and English UI strings. Translation files are located in `lang/vi.php` and `lang/en.php` and return associative arrays of key/value pairs.

A small loader `i18n.php` checks `$_GET['lang']` or `$_SESSION['lang']` to decide which file to include and exposes a helper function `__($key)` for fetching strings.

To switch language, use the links displayed in the header (`?lang=vi` or `?lang=en`). The selected language is stored in the session.

Example usage:

```php
// display login button
<button><?= __('login_button') ?></button>
```

Add new keys to the language files when new UI text appears.
